# Machine Learning Models from Scratch  

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python. 

The aim is to deepen the understanding of fundamental concepts while providing practical examples of how these models work under the hood.

## Repository Structure  

ðŸ“¦ MLMS

â”£ ðŸ“‚dataset

â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“„  - Contains data used for training and testing models.

â”£ ðŸ“‚models

â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“„ linear_regression_one_variable.ipynb - Implementation of linear regression for a single variable.

â”£ ðŸ“„ requirements.txt - File containing the required Python dependencies.

### Folders  

- **`dataset/`**: Contains datasets required for training and testing the models.
  
- **`models/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing a machine learning model from scratch.  

## Current Implementations  

1. **Linear Regression (One Variable)**  
   - Jupyter Notebook: [`linear_regression_one_variable.ipynb`](models/linear_regression_one_variable.ipynb)
  
   - Implements linear regression from scratch for a single independent variable, demonstrating the step-by-step process including hypothesis function, cost function, and gradient descent.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  

### Installing Dependencies  

To set up the environment, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd MLMS
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   conda create -n your_env_name python=3.x pip
   conda activate your_env_name
   ```
3.	Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. launch Jupyter Lab:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
